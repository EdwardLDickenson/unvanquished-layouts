This layout a "mission-style" layout in which aliens must
clean the fortification map after it has been invaded by
humans.
It is built for the following rules:

* `/lock h`: prevents players to join alien team;
* `/bot fill h 6; bot fill a 3`: recommended number of
	players;
* 2 human bots per alien (there is currently no way to
	have the game automatically manage this);
* `g_disabledClasses builder abuilder` to prevent alien
	team to build, as this makes the map way too easy to win;
